# House Price Predictions
An attempt at making an end-to-end machine learning project. A housing dataset containing information on house prices for houses in Washington State. 
I do some exploratory data analysis and use a pipeline to prepare the dataset for various models. Implemented a randomized search on 
model hyperparameters to help get a sense of which ones were useful. Then, a grid search was implemented to further fine-tune the hyperparameters. 
Finally, the models were evaluated using both RMSE and MAE to determine the final model.


## Project Goal
The overall goal was to get an idea of what an end-to-end machine learning project is and to become comfortable using scikit-learn's API.

## Project Takeaways
- Learned how to make a data pipeline, using it to be able to test various models.
- Learned about using grid search and randomized search for hyperparameter tuning
- Learned the importance of thoroughly planning out the pre-training part of the project, since having to go back to retrain the model can cost you time.
